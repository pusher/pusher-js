react-native runtime) from 4.1.1 to 5.9.7. Thanks to @Yinabled for the PR.

[ADDED] We were missing a react-native key in `package.json`. Thanks to @giaset
for the PR

[ADDED] Support for importing the worker builds (solving issue #499)

## 7.0.2 (2020-11-26)

[FIXED] Removes `AuthInfo` type from react-native and with-encryption builds.
This type was removed everywhere else in v7.0.0. See [issue
512](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js/issues/512)

## 7.0.1 (2020-11-02)

[FIXED] Channels no longer get stuck in the `subscriptionPending` state
after a failed request to an auth endpoint. [Fixes Issue
255](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js/issues/255)

## 7.0.0 (2020-07-30)

[UPDATED] Type signatures for authorizer callback. Previously the authorizer
callback had 2 arguments, the first was a boolean indicating that the second
was an error. Switched for a more conventional `function(err, data)` signature.
**This is a breaking change, if you use a custom authorizer**

[UPDATED] Types of errors emitted on `pusher:subscription_error` events.
Previously this event just contained the status code the auth endpoint
returned. This was replaced with a (hopefully) more error object with a message
and a `status` key.
**This is a breaking change, if you depend on the status in the
`pusher:subscription_error` event**

[FIXED] Stop wrapping websocket errors multiple times. [Fixes issue
464](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js/issues/464)
**This might be a breaking change, if you depend on the structure of `'error'` events
emitted by `pusher.connection`**

[FIXED] Stop swallowing errors thrown by handlers on encrypted channels.
Previously errors thrown by handlers bound to encrypted channels were caught
and ignored. This was unintentional and undesirable. [Fixes Issue
437](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js/issues/437)

## 6.0.3 (2020-05-14)

[FIXED] Added typescript declarations for the pusher-js/with-encryption build

[REMOVED] Unnecessary dummy tweetnacl types for react-native (thanks to
@dmitrybirin)

[UPDATED] Copyright years (thanks to @annzenkina)

## 6.0.2 (2020-04-30)

[FIXED] React-native import broken in release 6.0.1

## 6.0.1 (2020-04-30)

[CHANGED] Moved tweetnacl from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`. No
additional code is included in the bundle, but this gives the typescript
compiler access to the tweetnacl types

[FIXED] Typescript declarations for react-native. These were supposed to be
included in 6.0.0 but the commit was missed

## 6.0.0 (2020-04-27)

[CHANGED] The default builds for web and worker no longer support encrypted
channels. To use encrypted channels in web/worker you must import
`pusher-js/with-encryption` or use the
`pusher-with-encryption.js`/`pusher-with-encryption.min.js` bundles

[CHANGED] `forceTLS` now defaults to `true`

[REMOVED] the `encrypted` option - this was deprecated in `4.3.0`. The library
defaults to TLS anyway. Setting `encrypted` to `false` will **NOT** change
behaviour

[FIXED] `activityTimeout` and `pongTimeout` options now work as described in
the docs.

[NEW] Typescript declarations for react-native

[NEW] Support for encrypted-channels in react-native and workers

[FIXED] An issue with typescript declarations which caused builds to fail on
typescript projects dependent on pusher-js

## 5.1.0 (2020-02-11)

[NEW] Include typescript declarations

[CHANGED] Make stats opt in rather than opt out - Previously we sent some
metrics about connection strategies to stats.pusher.com by default, it could be
disabled by passing the `disableStats` option. This functionality is now off by
default and can be enabled by passing the `enableStats` option

[FIXED] An issue where local tests would hang for 300s if a browser wasn't
available

## 5.0.3 (2019-11-18)

[NEW] Log a warning when there is an auth error

[CHANGED] Default logger now uses console.warn and console.error

deprecation warnings

[CHANGED] output an ES6 module from typescript to allow webpack to optimise the
bundle more effectively (thanks to @stof for this change)

[CHANGED] Use prettier to format source

## 5.0.1 (2019-09-02)

[FIXED] We no longer include an unnecessary Buffer polyfill in bundles

## 5.0.0 (2019-07-19)

This is a major version bump but should only contain breaking change for
react-native users.

[CHANGED] The react-native build now assumes @react-native-community/netinfo is
available in the host project. This change was necessary since netinfo was
removed from react-native core.

[CHANGED] The reconnect strategy is no longer built with a DSL. This makes the
code much more easily optimised by the javascript engine and should improve
load times significantly. Thanks to @stof for his contribution.

[CHANGED] The project is now built with recent versions of webpack and
typescript. All other build deps were updated and the build process was
simplified.

[FIXED] An issue that broke encrypted channels in node has been resolved

[FIXED] Some consistently flaky tests were fixed and we switched to headless
browsers for test runs where possible (including in CI).

[CHANGED] The node dependencies are now bundled in the node dist file so that
web/react-native users don't need to install unnecessary dependencies

## 4.4.0 (2019-02-14)

[NEW] Callbacks bound to client events on presence channels will be called with an extra argument containing the `user_id` of the message sender

[FIXED] Only log with a custom logger when configured (prevents double
logging).

Many thanks to @sunweiyang, @rajivm and @WillSewell for their contributions!

## 4.2.1 (2017-09-28)

[FIXED] Correct version numbers in file headers (v4.2.0 still showed 4.1.0).

## 4.2.0 (2017-09-28)

[FIXED] Fixed an issue where pusher-js would not attempt to subscribe to
channels that were in the process of being subscribed to when the connection
failed.

## 1.9.6 (2011-11-16)

[FIXED] Issue in Mozilla Firefox 8, where making a connection to non-ssl websocket endpoint from a secure page results in a security exception.

## 1.9.5 (2011-11-15)

[FIXED] NetInfo listening as to not clobber the window.ononline and window.onoffline variables. Fixes issue #9.

[FIXED] Loading of web-socket-js on Mozilla browsers with MozWebSocket, issue #10.

[UPGRADE] Test framework to run in most browsers (IE6+, FF3+, Opera 11.52+, Safari, Chrome). Includes various other improvements to tests and testing infrastructure.

[NEW] Smarter SSL only error detection. If a connection is closed by pusher with an error saying that the app is in SSL only mode, then we will now force all future connection attempts to use SSL.

[NEW] Added guards around the JSON.parse calls in the Ajax Authoriser for private and presence channels.

## 1.9.4 (2011-09-12)

[FIX] Fixed bug which meant that presence channels only worked correctly when `user_info` was supplied. It's now possible to use presence channels without specifying `user_info` (`user_id` is required).

## 1.9.3 (2011-08-19)

[FIX] Fixed JSON dependency loading properly, rather than bundling it always.

## 1.9.2 (2011-08-04)

[NEW] Cleverer reconnection behaviour.

If Connection is connected and the window.ononffline event is fired, this indicates that the computer has lost its connection to the local router.  In response, the Connection immediately closes the socket.

If Connection is disconnected and waiting to reattempt a connection, and the window.ononline event is fired, the Connection tries to connect immediately, rather than waiting for the current waiting period to elapse.

If the window is about to attempt a connection and the window.navigator.onLine variable is false, the Connection immediately goes to the unavailable state.

Note: window.ononline, window.onoffline and window.navigator.onLine are only supported by some browsers.

[NEW] If channel authentication AJAX request returns a status code that is not 200, a `subscription_error` event is triggered.  The `subscription_error` can be bound to so that the library user can respond to the failure.

[FIX] Works with IE7 again, after being broken in 1.9.0.

[FIX] Traffic Light connection status demo works in installations of Firefox 3.6 without Firebug.

## 1.9.1 (2011-07-18)

[FIX] Client events triggering fixed (broken by 1.9.0)

[FIX] Removed verbose logging of internal state machine transitions

## 1.9.0 (2011-07-15)

[NEW] New API to allow binding to changes in connection state. See blog post for details.

[NEW] Support for Firefox 6 native WebSocket using MozWebSocket prefix

[REMOVED] Old connection state events: `pusher:connection_established`, `pusher:connection_failed`, `pusher:connection_disconnected`.

[CHANGED] Socket id now accessed via `pusher.connection.socket_id` rather than `pusher.socket_id`.

## 1.8.6 (2011-08-19)

[NEW] Support for Firefox 6 native WebSocket using MozWebSocket prefix

## 1.8.5 (2011-06-18)

[FIX] Fix the fact that member was being added to the global scope

[CHANGE] `Pusher.log` function now always receives a single string argument rather than multiple arguments, making it easier to use. If you want more control, you can over-ride `Pusher.debug`

## 1.8.4 (2011-06-18)

[FIX] When using multiple presence channels concurrently, the members object for each channel now operates as expected

## 1.8.3 (2011-04-19)

[FIX] Delay Pusher initialization until document.body is defined. This fixes an issue in Firefox < 4 & IE which occasionally caused a "document.body is null"  error when loading the flash fallback.

[UPGRADE] Upgraded linked version of web-socket-js. Amongst other things this removes the dependency on FABridge and reduces the minified size of fallback dependencies by 13KB.
For the full list of changes in web-socket-js see <https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js/compare/6640d9d806972ea1720a273d09e8919464bcd131...bb5797cad5244dc86410e35726ef886bbc49afe9>

## 1.8.2 (2011-03-29)

[BUGFIX] When loaded onto a HTTPS page, load pusher dependencies from HTTPS.

## 1.8.1 (2011-03-21)

[BUGFIX] Minor fix which could have allowed `member_removed` to be triggered with nil.

[CHANGE] Increased default connection timeout to reduce likelyhood of timeouts on first connection attempt. This is now configurable as `Pusher.connection_timeout`.

## 1.8.0 (2011-02-10)

[NEW] Support triggering client events with new API

    channel.trigger('client-myeventname', {
      some: 'data'
    })

[NEW] Support for new socket presence interface, and changed javascript API. The `subscription_succeeded` event now returns an iterator object:

    presence_channel.bind('pusher:subscription_succeeded', function(members) {
     members.each(function(member) {
       console.log(member.id, member.info)
     })
    })

Also, the member object passed to `member_added` and `member_removed` now has attributes `id` and `info` rather than `user_id` and `user_info`.

[CHANGED] Improved javascript debug console logging.

## 1.7.6 (2011-03-29)

[BUGFIX] When loaded onto a HTTPS page, load pusher dependencies from HTTPS [backported from 1.8.2].

## 1.7.5 (2011-03-21)

[CHANGE] Increased default connection timeout to reduce likelyhood of timeouts on first connection attempt. This is now configurable as `Pusher.connection_timeout` [backported from 1.8.1].

## 1.7.4 (2011-02-09)

[FIXED] Javascript error was raised in the case that neither native WebSockets nor Flash were available.

[FIXED] Updated linked version of web-socket-js, which fixes issue connecting from Android, allows connection attempts to timeout and retry correctly. For full details see <https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js/compare/2776dcfbf7847a5e19505432d8d63f8814e37b52...6640d9d806972ea1720a273d09e8919464bcd131>

## 1.7.3 (2011-02-01)

[FIXED] Pusher could fail to initialize in IE 7 & 8 when dependencies cached

## 1.7.2 (2011-01-25)

[FIXED] pusher.min.js now loads minified rather than unminified dependencies.

[CHANGED] Using JBundle for bundling the distribution. This should not in any way affect the minified files, it just simplifies building them.

## 1.7.1

Wrap timeout around connections so that silently hanging connections are retried.

More robust reconnection logic, with initially shorter reconnect delay, but with increasing backoff.

## 1.7.0

Encrypted apps: apps can now be configured to connect via SSL only. There is a corresponding setting in your dashboard which will reject non encrypted connections.

    var pusher = new Pusher('your-key', {
      encrypted: true
    })

Note that the second argument to the Pusher constructor for setting channel names has been removed. You should use `pusher.subscribe instead`. THIS NO LONGER WORKS:

    var pusher = new Pusher('your-key', 'channel-name') # DOES NOT WORK

## 1.6.4

JSONp support for presence and private channels

Configurable transport for channel auths. JSONp allows for cross-domain channel authorization (ie. embedable widgets)

    Pusher.channel_auth_transport = 'jsonp';

The default is Ajax for backwards compatibility. Ajax mode POSTS to Pusher.channel_auth_endpoint, whereas JSONp GETs.

For JSONp to work, your server must wrap the response in the callback name provided as a query parameter. Ruby example (using Pusher Gem) and Rails:

    auth = Pusher[channel_name].authenticate(params[:socket_id], {
      :user_id => current_user.id,
      :user_info => {:name => current_user.name}
    })

    render :text => params[:callback] + "(" + JSON.generate(auth) + ");"

## 1.6.3

Fixed presence bug for removed duplicate members.

If I connect as the same user in different browser windows or tabs, clients should trigger remove that member from a channel's member list only when the last window/tab is closed.

See http://pusher.tenderapp.com/discussions/questions/11-presence-of-friends for discussion.

## 1.6.2

Dynamically load Javascript and Flash dependencies only for browsers that need them. Including pusher.js will:

IE: require JSON2, require and activate Flash fallback.
Firefox 3.6x: require and activate Flash fallback
Chrome, Safari: don't require anything. These browsers already have WebSocket and JSON support.

This saves a lot of bandwidth and makes page loads faster.

## 1.6

Initial Presence support. Subscribing to presence channels allows you to respond to people entering and leaving the channel in your UI, to show who is has a connection open. More documentation here: http://pusherapp.com/docs/presence.

## 1.5

Updated the library to use a version of the swf file hosted by Pusher. This makes it more convenient to integrate and avoids version conflicts in future.

Add some full-stack integration tests that interact with the production Pusher environment.

## 1.4.3

Trigger pusher:connection\_failed if no websocket is defined, allowing the event to work on iphones etc.

## 1.4.2

 * Removed switch\_to\_secure and switch\_to\_unsecure in favour of automatic failover to ssl
 * Generate internal events pusher:connection\_disconnected and pusher:connection\_failed
 * Responds to pusher:connection\_established preparing for deprecation of connection\_established

## 1.4.1

Added switch\_to\_secure() and switch\_to\_unsecure() to enable ssl testing

## 1.4

Add ability to bind events to a specific channel:

    var server = new Pusher("API_KEY", "my-channel")
    server.channel("my-channel").bind("my-event", function(data) {
      // do something
    })

## 1.3

Add support for subscribing to private channels. Retrieves an authentication string via Ajax from your server - for more information view the docs: <http://pusherapp.com/docs/private_channels>

## 1.2.1

Basic support for subscribing to multiple channels:

    var server = new Pusher("API_KEY", "my-channel")
    server.subscribe("another-channel")
    server.unsubscribe("my-channel")

## 1.2

Build a single Javascript file including all dependencies for Flash fallback and browsers that don't have a native JSON implementation.

## 1

First release!
